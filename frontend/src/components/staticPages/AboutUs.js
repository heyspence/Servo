                <p>Our mission is to minimize humanity's expenditure on quoting, scheduling, and billing tasks for home services.</p>
            <br/>
                <p>

                Servo is a group of people putting their skills and interests to use by freeing up time for humanity to do meaningful work. 
                There is an amount of friction involved in caring for our homes. This friction is costly and unneccesary. 
                The technologies that can minimize this friction already exist, we just put the peices together in order to solve this long overdue problem.

                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>In 2016, Servo's vision of simplifing the home service industry was born... it just didn't have a name yet. Starting with the idea of streamlining overlapping costs for service businesses like house cleaning and pest control, we've spent years refining our approach.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Our journey took a significant leap forward between 2021 and 2022 when our prototype was developed on Shopify. 
                    As the need for more advanced technologies grew, all aspects of Servo were brought in-house and developed again from stratch, this time with advanced features in mind. 
                    Reconstruction of Servo started in late 2023 and is poised to launch again in 2024.</p>
            </section>
            <h2>Thank You!</h2>
            <p>Thank you for choosing Servo. Together, we're not just booking services; we're building a meaningful future. The purchases you make on Servo are the lifeblood of what moves this mission forward.</p>
