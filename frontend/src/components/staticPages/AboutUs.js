                <h2>Our Beginning</h2>
                <p>In 2016, Servo was born out of a vision to simplify the booking of home services... it just didn't have a name yet. Starting with an idea to bring pricing, booking, and payment for services like house cleaning and pest control online, we've spent years refining our approach to meet your needs.</p>

                <h2>Building Our Foundation</h2>
                <p>Our journey took a significant leap forward between 2019 and 2020 when our prototype was developed on Shopify. Recognizing the need for advanced technical skills, our founder attended App Academy, excelling as one of the top performers. This experience was pivotal in rebuilding Servo on dedicated hardware, laying the groundwork for a robust and reliable platform.</p>
